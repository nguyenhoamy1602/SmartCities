Using Truffle Init Pack

## Building and the frontend

1. Run `testrpc` for local Etherium Client

3. Run `truffle console`, then `exec input.js`
4. On another terminal tab, run `npm run dev` to build the app and serve it on http://localhost:8080

## Possible upgrades

* Add Map to track sensor in real location
* Product lookUp linked to sensor
* Recommendation for similar product with lower carbon emission
